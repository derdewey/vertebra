== Setting Up Your Environment

Currently, the integration tests require the vertebra configuration files to be
installed in order to run. The sample config files provided with herault,
entrepot and cavalcade in the vertebra-erl projects are set up for the
integration tests.

The simplest way to install those config files is to just install Vertebra:

  $ ./configure && make && make install

In addition to the config files, you will need a working instance of ejabberd
(deps.sh can install it for you). You will need to configure the following
users:

JID                              PASSWORD
-------------------------        --------
admin@localhost                  any - your choice
herault@localhost                "testing"
rd00-n00@localhost               "testing"
rd00-s00000@localhost            "testing"
vertebra-client@localhost        "testing"
cavalcade@localhost              "testing"
entrepot@localhost               "testing"

== Running Integration Tests

A rakefile has been provided alongside the integration tests that will run
them. From the top level directory all you need to do is:

  $ rake -f integration/Rakefile
