== Setting Up Your Environment

Currently, the integration tests require the vertebra configuration files to be
installed in order to run. The sample config files provided with herault,
entrepot and cavalcade in the vertebra-erl projects are set up for the
integration tests.

The simplest way to install those config files is to just install Vertebra:

  $ ./configure && make && make install

In addition to the config files, you will need a working instance of ejabberd
(deps.sh can install it for you). You will need to configure the following
users:

JID                              PASSWORD
-------------------------        --------
admin@localhost                  any - your choice
herault@localhost                "testing"
rd00-n00@localhost               "testing"
rd00-s00000@localhost            "testing"
vertebra-client@localhost        "testing"
cavalcade@localhost              "testing"
entrepot@localhost               "testing"

== Running Integration Tests

Currently the integration tests live in the vertebra-rb project. If everything
has been set up then all you have to do to run them is:

 $ cd vertebra-rb
 $ rake integration
