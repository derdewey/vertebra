== Where to get Vertebra

The source code is always available via Git:

  $ git clone git://github.com/engineyard/vertebra.git
  $ cd vertebra
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

When switching between branches you need to remember to update the
submodules. So to checkout the 0.4.0 tag to a branch you'd do this:

  $ git checkout -b v0.4.0 0.4.0
  $ git submodule update

Then when you went back to master you'd do this:

  $ git checkout master
  $ git submodule update

== Dependencies

We have provided a script (deps.sh) that installs some dependencies in
/opt/local/vertebra:

 * Erlang OTP (R12B-5)
 * ejabberd (2.0.2)
 * erlsom (1.2.1)

The script also installs the following gems using the gem command found on your
PATH:

 * rspec
 * open4
 * thor
 * rr
 * hoe

The following dependencies are not installed:

 * expat (most systems have this)
 * gcc (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * iconv (glibc systems have this, only needed for ejabberd mod_irc)
 * make (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * glib (most linux systems have this, needed for loudmouth)
 * loudmouth (see note below)
 * loudmouth-ruby
 * openssl (most systems have this)
 * ruby
 * rubygems
 * wget OR curl (this includes most Macs and Linux machines)
 * zlib (most systems have this)

=== Loudmouth

The ruby agent library requires the latest versions of both the loudmouth
library and the loudmouth-ruby bindings in order to work properly.

As of this writing the latest version of loudmouth is 1.5.0. It is available
at:

  http://engineyard.github.com/loudmouth/download/loudmouth-1.5.0.tar.gz

Similarly, the latest version of the bindings is 0.3.0. They are available at:

  http://engineyard.github.com/loudmouth/download/loudmouth-ruby-0.3.0.tar.gz

== Installation

If you are installing from git you need to run this command to set up the build
system:

  $ autoreconf --install && autoreconf

Then to install everything:

  $ ./deps.sh -a
  $ ./configure && make && make install

What is installed can be broken down into three categories: vertebra libraries,
and vertebra actors.

==== Vertebra Libraries

 * vertebra-rb -- Core agent library for ruby.
 * vertebra-erl -- Core agent library for erlang and core vertebra services.

==== Vertebra Actors

 * vertebra-gemtool -- Actor for managing ruby gems.
 * vertebra-xen -- Actor for accessing Xen slice information.
